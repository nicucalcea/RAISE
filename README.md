RAISE: R-based AI for Structured Extraction
================

This is an experimental library for using ChatGPT to help with difficult
to automate tasks.

ChatGPT is new and tends to
[hallucinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)),
so it will return data that is wrong or doesnâ€™t even exist. Use at your
own risk.
