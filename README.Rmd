This is an experimental library for using ChatGPT to help with difficult to automate tasks, such as parsing unstructured text into structured data.

ChatGPT is new and tends to [hallucinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)), so it will return data that is wrong or doesn't even exist. Use at your own risk.
